        <h2 id="Spawning">Spawning</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>The <b>wither</b> is spawned by placing 4 blocks of soul sand in a T shape (see image to the left), and putting 3 wither skeleton 
             skulls on top of the three upper blocks. The <u>last block</u> placed must be one of the three skulls,
             and can be placed by the player or a dispenser.</p>
        <h2 id="Drops">Drops</h2>
        <hr>
             <p>The <b>wither</b> always drops the nether star upon death which, until picked up, cannot despawn or be destroyed by explosions.
             The Looting enchantment <i>does not</i> increase this drop. It also drops 50 experience points
             when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.</p>

            <p>When spawned, the <b>wither</b> grows larger in size as its health bar fills up. While in this state, 
            the <b>wither</b> is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks. When this state ends (after 10 seconds), 
            the <b>wither</b> creates a very large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing 
            up to 68hp Ã— 34 damage to nearby mobs/players.</p>

            <ul>
                 <li>According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.</li>
                 <li>There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.</li>
                 <li>The wither does not take damage from undead mobs' attacks.</li>
                  <li>If the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.</li>
